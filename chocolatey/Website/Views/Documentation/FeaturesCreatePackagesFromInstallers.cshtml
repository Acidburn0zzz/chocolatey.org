<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-take-advantage-of-this-feature">How do I take advantage of this feature?</h3>
<p>You must have a <a href="https://chocolatey.org/compare">Business edition of Chocolatey</a>. Business editions are great for organizations that need to manage the total software management lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="im-a-licensed-customer-now-what">I&#39;m a licensed customer, now what?</h3>
<p>When you run <code>choco new</code>, you can add <code>--file</code> and point Chocolatey at the installer file and let Chocolatey figure out everything for creating a package and the silent arguments and wrap that around the installer.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>It inspects the installer file using a series of rules that helps determine the installer type. From there it builds a package with the information it is able to extract from the installer.</p>
<h3 id="will-it-catch-all-types-of-installers">Will it catch all types of installers?</h3>
<p>It is able to detect 12 types of installers currently.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-always-find-the-silent-uninstall-arguments">Does it always find the silent uninstall arguments?</h3>
<p>In over 90% of the cases it will, but not always. Even with this in mind, it still removes 90% of the packaging work. See the next question on how to handle cases where it can not.</p>
<h3 id="this-was-unable-to-detect-custom-installer-arguments.">This was unable to detect custom installer arguments.</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, some installers out there are just a pain to work with. In the case of custom installers, you may be able to find the silent arguments for install and uninstall by searching online. If you can not find anything, consider unpacking the installer and putting the software binaries directly in the package.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-create-auto-unattend-files">Does it create auto unattend files?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not able to do this. See the <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "features-automatically-recompile-packages" })">automatic internalize and recompile packages feature</a> to take advantage of thousands of existing packages without a need for internet access.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-work-with-zip-archive">Does it work with zip archive?</h3>
<p>Not currently, but archives are on the future enhancements list.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-work-with-keeping-the-installer-on-a-unc-share-or-elsewhere-yet">Does this work with keeping the installer on a UNC share or elsewhere yet?</h3>
<p>Not yet, but it&#39;s easy to edit the package once it has done all of the hard work for you.</p>
