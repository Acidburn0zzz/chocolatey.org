<h1 id="private-cdn-download-cache-licensed-editions-only">Private CDN Download Cache (Licensed Editions Only)</h1>
<p>Chocolatey offers a private CDN cache of download content for <a href="https://chocolatey.org/pricing">customers</a>! The internet is unpredictable and sometimes sites go down, the cache ensures that the packages on the community repository are not broken by issues with the internet. We lovingly call this the &quot;<strong>No more 404s feature</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>We do this by caching a copy of the content on our private CDN. This content also gets virus checked and checksummed to verify that it matches what was originally intended by package maintainers and moderators for you to receive.</p>
<h2 id="important-information-for-software-vendors">Important Information for Software Vendors</h2>
<p>When our customers download content from you, we may cache a copy of that content on our private CDN to ensure that later our licensed customers will be able to access that content again. This allows predictable and reliable installations of packages. Like most CDNs, no changes are made, we are simply ensuring the content stays available for our private customers. We are not modifying, selling, renting, leasing, lending, or sub-licensing this content in any way.</p>
<p>This private content cache is <strong><em>only</em></strong> available as a service for our <a href="https://chocolatey.org/pricing">licensed customers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions or <strong>prefer to opt out</strong>, please <a href="https://chocolatey.org/contact">contact us</a> and select &quot;Software Vendor Opt Out&quot; (vendor requests only please).</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>This is mostly automatic, but in case the feature is turned off, you may turn it on by setting the feature <code>downloadCache</code> (<code>choco feature enable -n downloadCache</code>).</p>
<p>To see if a package has content cached on the CDN, you can run <code>choco info packagename</code> and it will give you detailed information pertaining to a package.</p>
<p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/docs/choco_info_cached.png")" alt="choco info packagename" /></p>
<p>When you install, you will see a message similar to the following when the cached content is used:</p>
<p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/docs/choco_install_cached.png")" alt="Pro install with CDN cache" /></p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-take-advantage-of-this-feature">How do I take advantage of this feature?</h3>
<p>You must have a <a href="https://chocolatey.org/pricing">licensed edition of Chocolatey</a> (Pro and/or Business). Pro is a personal, named license that costs about the price of a lunch outing per month and comes with several other features. Business editions are great for organizations that need more business friendly features from their software management tool.</p>
