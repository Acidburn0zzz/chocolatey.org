<h2 id="notice-as-of-0.9.8.24-chocolateys-default-install-location-is-cprogramdatachocolatey"><span style="color:red;">NOTICE: As of 0.9.8.24, Chocolatey&#39;s default install location is C:\ProgramData\Chocolatey</span></h2>
<p>This reduces the attack surface on a local installation of Chocolatey and limits who can make changes to the directory.</p>
<p>You can install Chocolatey to Program Files if you feel that is a more appropriate place. Because Chocolatey has files that change with package installations and it doesn&#39;t actually install to Programs and Features (what we consider synonymous with Program Files), we didn&#39;t feel this was the appropriate location. Plus with logging currently all in the same location, it would mean you would need to run <code>choco</code> with administrative permissions every time, even if you are just doing things like searching for packages, finding out what is installed locally, etc.</p>
