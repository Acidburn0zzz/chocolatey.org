<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The Chocolatey agent enables two simultaneous modes of operation, one as an agent for a central console and the other as a background service for use in controlled environments. You can configure one or both modes.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chocolatey (<code>chocolatey</code> package) v0.10.3+ - v0.10.4+ for better compatibility. Chocolatey v0.10.7+ is recommended and required in newer versions.</li>
<li>Chocolatey for Business (C4B) Edition</li>
<li>Chocolatey Licensed Extension (<code>chocolatey.extension</code> package) v1.8.4+. For chocolatey-agent v0.5.0+, licensed extension v1.9.0+. For <code>chocolatey-agent</code> v0.7.0+, licensed extension v1.11.0+.</li>
<li>Chocolatey Agent Service (<code>chocolatey-agent</code> package) - 0.7.0+ is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>For use with Chocolatey GUI, you must be on Chocolatey v0.10.7+, Chocolatey Licensed Extension v1.11.0+, and Chocolatey Agent v0.7.0+.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>To install the Chocolatey agent service, you need to install the <code>chocolatey-agent</code> package. The Chocolatey Agent is only available for business edition customers to install from the licensed source (customers trialling the business edition will also be provided instructions on how to install).</p>
<h4 id="background-mode-setup">Background Mode Setup</h4>
<p>To set Chocolatey in background mode, you need to run the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>choco upgrade chocolatey-agent &lt;options&gt;</code> (see <a href="#chocolatey-agent-install-options">agent install options</a>)</li>
<li><code>choco feature disable -n showNonElevatedWarnings</code> - requires Chocolatey v0.10.4+ to set.</li>
<li><code>choco feature enable -n useBackgroundService</code></li>
<li>You also need to opt in sources in for self-service packages. See <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "commands-source" })">choco source</a> (and <code>--allow-self-service</code>). Alternatively, you can allow any configured source to be used for self-service by running the following: <code>choco feature disable -n useBackgroundServiceWithSelfServiceSourcesOnly</code> (requires Chocolatey Extension v1.10.0+).</li>
<li>If you want self-service to apply only to non-administrators, run <code>choco feature enable -n useBackgroundServiceWithNonAdministratorsOnly</code> (requires Chocolatey Extension v1.11.1+).</li>
<li>If you want to configure custom commands (not just install/upgrade), use something like <code>choco config set backgroundServiceAllowedCommands &quot;install,upgrade,pin,sync&quot;</code> (with the commands you want to allow, requires Chocolatey Extension v1.12.4+). See <a href="#command-customization-consideration">commands consideration</a> below.</li>
<li>For use with Chocolatey GUI, you need Chocolatey Extension v1.12.4+, and at least Chocolatey GUI v0.14.0-unstable0345. <strong>Uninstall any version of the GUI you already have installed first</strong>, then run <code>choco upgrade chocolateygui -y --pre --version 0.14.0-unstable0345 --source https://www.myget.org/F/chocolateygui/ --allow-downgrade</code> (you will also need at least .NET 4.5.2 installed)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="chocolatey-agent-install-options">Chocolatey Agent Install Options</h5>
<p>Starting with Chocolatey Agent v0.8.0+, the service will install as a local administrative user <code>ChocolateyLocalAdmin</code> by default (and manage the password as well). However you can specify your own user with package parameters (or have it use LocalSystem). Using a local administrator account allows for more things to be installed without issues. It also will allow easier shortcuts and other items to be put back on the correct user (the original requestor). You can specify a domain account as well. Prior to <code>v0.8.0</code>, Chocolatey Agent would install as LocalSystem (<code>SYSTEM</code>) and would require additional customization.</p>
<p><strong>Package Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/Username:</code> - provide username - intead of using the default &#39;ChocolateyLocalAdmin&#39; user.</li>
<li><code>/Password:</code> - optional password for the user.</li>
<li><code>/EnterPassword</code> - receive the password at runtime as a secure string</li>
<li><code>/UseDefaultChocolateyConfigUser</code> - use the default username from Chocolatey&#39;s configuration. This may be LocalSystem.</li>
<li><code>/NoRestartService</code> - do not shut down and restart the service. You will need to restart later to take advantage of new service information.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="command-customization-consideration">Command Customization Consideration</h5>
<p>Starting with Chocolatey Licensed Extension v1.12.4, you are allowed to configure what commands can be routed through the background service. Please note that we default to install and upgrade as that is the most secure experience. However you can add uninstall and some other commands as well. Uninstall does have some security considerations as it would allow a non-administrator to remove software that you may have installed, including the background service itself.</p>
<p><strong>Available Commands</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>info - do not add if you want sources hidden from non-admins</li>
<li>list/search - do not add if you want sources hidden from non-admins</li>
<li>install</li>
<li>upgrade</li>
<li>uninstall - keep in mind there may be security implications for this</li>
<li>optimize</li>
<li>outdated - do not add if you want sources hidden from non-admins</li>
<li>pin</li>
<li>sync</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blacklisted Commands</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>config</li>
<li>feature</li>
<li>source</li>
<li>apikey</li>
</ul>
<p>Chocolatey does not allow for configuration changing commands to be routed through the background service as that would allow users to be able to change configuration and that could be detrimental. For instance, a user could add a local source with a package they&#39;ve created that promotes themselves to an administrator (escalation of privilege). As that constitutes a security issue, we do not allow it.</p>
<p>For the same reason, we do not recommend allowing sources you do not control to be allowed for self-service.</p>
<h3 id="chocolatey-background-service-self-service-installer">Chocolatey Background Service / Self-Service Installer</h3>
<p>When an administrator installs the agent, they can configure Chocolatey to use background mode so that non-administrators can still perform installations of approved software as configured by an administrator.</p>
<p>Why this is desirable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users do not need to be administrators but are still empowered to install and upgrade software (functions are configurable with Chocolatey Extension v1.12.4+)</li>
<li>Users can only run install and upgrade in an administrative context.</li>
<li>Shortcuts, desktop icons, etc created through Chocolatey functions will end up with the proper user.</li>
<li>Users can only install approved software based on admin configured sources.</li>
<li>This frees up precious IT bandwidth to work on other engagements.</li>
<li>Empowers users, so they feel more in control.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes for happy users and happy admins as they are able to move quicker towards a better organization.</p>
<h4 id="self-service-roadmap">Self-Service Roadmap:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Admins will be able to schedule when upgrades occur (maintenance windows).</li>
<li><del>Admins will be able to configure what commands can be run through the background service.</del> Completed with Chocolatey Extension v1.12.4.</li>
<li>Admins will have more granular control of what certain users can install.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chocolatey-central-console">Chocolatey Central Console</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The console is estimated to be available by end of 2017. All notes here are what we expect, but the standard disclaimer of availability and features apply.</p>
<p>Chocolatey will have a central core console that will allow you to manage your environments. You will need the Chocolatey Agent installed on all machines you wish to manage centrally.</p>
<h4 id="chocolatey-central-console-roadmap">Chocolatey Central Console Roadmap</h4>
<p>The console will allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized Software Management for your entire organization.</li>
<li>Centralized reporting of software.</li>
<li>Know immediately what software is out of date and on what machines.</li>
<li>Know within seconds the entire estate of software and what versions are installed.</li>
<li>Including zips and archives* that do not show up in Programs and Features</li>
<li>Including internal software* that does not show up in Programs and Features</li>
<li>Adhoc reporting for a particular machine or set of machines</li>
<li>Run arbitrary Chocolatey commands against one or more machines</li>
<li>See how many machines you are actively managing in your organization</li>
<li>More...</li>
</ul>
<p>* - When deployed through Chocolatey.</p>
<h2 id="see-it-in-action">See It In Action</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s a short 8 minute walkthrough (preview):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HRmbTQ9wNM" title="Chocolatey&#39;s Self-Service Install - Background Mode (Preview)"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/21634430/d8b94416-d21c-11e6-80c6-6a1b6def72fc.png" alt="Chocolatey&#39;s Self-Service Install - Background Mode (Preview)" /></a></p>
<p>Consider the following image:</p>
<p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/docs/features/features_non_admin_installer.png")" alt="Attempting to install software as non-admin - if you are on https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-agent-service, see commented html below for detailed description of image" /></p>
<!--
Text in the image above:

Non-administrators need an administrator to perform installs.

This image shows attempting to install VLC as a non-administrator and having the computer show the question for an administrator username and password to continue.
-->
<p>This is the status quo for a non-administrative user. Can&#39;t install software without the help of an administrator. That takes up time, time for both the user waiting to get work done and the IT admin that performs the work.</p>
<p>Now, how does that change once we have background mode?</p>
<p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/docs/features/features_non_admin_selfservice.png")" alt="Installing software with Chocolatey&#39;s background mode from the command line. - if you are on https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-agent-service, see commented html below for detailed description of image" /></p>
<!--
Text in the image above:

Background Mode / Self-Service Installer

- Non-admin can install only from approved, configured sources
- Chocolatey Agent Service validates commands prior to running
- Output streams as it happens
- Attempted abuses are logged for further review
- Background mode only for install / upgrade by default
- GUI on roadmap

This image shows running `choco install adobereader -y`.
-->
<p>Once you&#39;ve configured background mode and configured approved sources for installation, a user can install only those approved applications using the command line or the Chocolatey GUI (coming soon).</p>
<p>Now, if a user wants to install from a non-approved source, they are met with the following message:<br />
<img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/docs/features/features_non_admin_custom_source_error.png")" alt="Not able to install from custom source" /></p>
<p>This ensures non-admin users can only install from sources that you configure.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-take-advantage-of-chocolatey-agent">How do I take advantage of Chocolatey Agent?</h3>
<p>You must have a <a href="https://chocolatey.org/compare">Business edition of Chocolatey</a>. Business editions are great for organizations that need to manage the total software lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="im-a-licensed-customer-now-what">I&#39;m a licensed customer, now what?</h3>
<p>Once you have the agent service installed and Chocolatey for Business configured for background mode (see <a href="#setup">Setup</a> above), most tools that use Chocolatey will automatically use the background service.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-puppet-or-some-other-configuration-management-tool-rmm-tool-infrastructure-automation-tool-etc-that-also-runs-chocolatey-can-i-configure-it-to-skip-background-mode">I have Puppet or some other configuration management tool (RMM tool, infrastructure automation tool, etc.) that also runs Chocolatey. Can I configure it to skip background mode?</h3>
<p>Yes! Add <code>--run-actual</code> to your install options. Most likely your tool won&#39;t need to be reconfigured though as it will just work with background mode. You will need Chocolatey v0.10.3+ installed across your environment so Chocolatey handles the unknown arguments appropriately.</p>
<p>Another way to handle this as of Chocolatey Extension v1.12.0, turn on the <code>useBackgroundServiceWithNonAdministratorsOnly</code> feature to make self-service apply only to non-administrators. See <a href="#background-mode-setup">Background Mode Setup</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="im-getting-the-following-there-are-no-sources-enabled-for-packages-and-none-were-passed-as-arguments">I&#39;m getting the following: &quot;There are no sources enabled for packages and none were passed as arguments.&quot;</h3>
<p>This means you need to opt a source into self-service (new in Chocolatey Extension v1.10).</p>
<p>This just involves ensuring a source is set so that it allows self-service. To do this you run <code>choco source add -n name -s location &lt;--other details need repeated&gt; --allow-self-service</code>. Editing a source happens when the name is the same in <code>choco source add</code>.</p>
<p>To change this behavior back to the way it was previously, simply run <code>choco disable -n useBackgroundServiceWithSelfServiceSourcesOnly</code>. For feature options, run <code>choco feature list</code> or see <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "chocolatey-configuration" })#self-service-background-mode">Self-Service Feature Configuration</a></p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>As a background service, it is able to call Chocolatey with an administrative account that is configured by you. It is secure communication that only starts once Chocolatey is configured to work with the background service.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-minimum-chocolatey-licensed-extension-version-that-i-need-to-install-the-agent">What&#39;s the minimum Chocolatey licensed extension version that I need to install the agent?</h3>
<p>You need <code>chocolatey.extension</code> version 1.8.4+.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-secure">How is it secure?</h3>
<p>For background mode / self-service installer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands are ignored unless they come from the business edition of Chocolatey.</li>
<li>Chocolatey installs can only be done from approved, configured sources.</li>
<li>The background service validates commands prior to running.</li>
<li>Attempted abuses of the service are logged for further review by an administrator later.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the central console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming later when central console is more complete.</li>
<li>Communication will be done over TLS (w/self-signed certificate) or another medium with message encryption</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-you-have-an-example-of-a-message-that-goes-across-the-agent-service-named-pipe-from-the-client">Do you have an example of a message that goes across the agent service named pipe, from the client?</h3>
<p>The message is a serialized object that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>hashed passcode - SHA512 Hash of args, user, current directory, and a salt value only shared with agent and licensed edition</li>
<li>command arguments to run - verified against validation checks</li>
<li>username - this is what we&#39;ll use to ensure things like desktop shortcuts, etc</li>
<li>timeout - how long before the command should timeout (from choco config)</li>
<li>working directory - where is the context of this being executed, in case there are things to place relative to current directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the interface:</p>
<p><code>void run_choco_command(string passcode, IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; arguments, string userName, int timeout, string workingDirectory);</code></p>
<p>Keep in mind this message is only put on localhost. It does not go over any networks.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-the-hash-that-is-used-to-protect-the-named-pipe">What is the purpose of the hash that is used to protect the named pipe?</h3>
<p>You may notice the hash changes every time based on what command is called. This is a security measure to ensure the call is coming from a configured Chocolatey client and not from another source. The agent will ignore anything that does not match up.</p>
<h3 id="does-the-agent-service-or-chocolatey-stop-installation-from-unconfigured-sources">Does the agent service or Chocolatey stop installation from unconfigured sources?</h3>
<p>The agent stops unconfigured sources from installation. Right now it simply logs those abuses to the log file (that is locked down to admins for modify). The log file can be slurped into a tool like Splunk. Alternatively considering this is preview and we are waiting for feedback, we can look to providing those alerts in a different way, like the event log. We welcome any feedback on how you might like to see this.</p>
<p>Chocolatey doesn&#39;t stop unconfigured sources for install, it lets the agent do so. Once Chocolatey is in background mode, all commands for install/upgrade go through the agent service.</p>
<p>The one exception is when someone calls <code>--run-actual</code> in their arguments. But there is no escalation of privilege here because they would be running that under their own user context and thus only have the permissions granted to them already.</p>
<h3 id="im-having-trouble-seeing-packages-on-a-file-share-source">I&#39;m having trouble seeing packages on a file share source</h3>
<p>The Chocolatey Agent service installs as LocalSystem by default, which may not have access to UNC shares. We recommend changing the service to a named account that is a local admin that would also have network access. You can do that in the Service Manager properties for the service itself (future state through package parameters). Please note you would need to make this change on each upgrade of the Agent until it is supported in the packaging itself.</p>
<p>So if you&#39;ve set up a source like <code>choco source add -n=&quot;'name'&quot; -s=&quot;'\\unc\packages'&quot; --priority=1</code>, by default this won&#39;t work with the Chocolatey Agent. You would need to grant access to machines or anonymous access to the share (Everyone Read is likely not enough).</p>
<p>A great read on your options can be found at the following Stack Exchange links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://serverfault.com/q/135867/79259" class="uri">https://serverfault.com/q/135867/79259</a></li>
<li><a href="https://serverfault.com/q/41130/79259" class="uri">https://serverfault.com/q/41130/79259</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A way to do this with LocalSystem (the default):</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a global group on the Domain
<ul>
<li>add all machines to this group</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add this group to the share permissions with &quot;Read&quot; Access</li>
<li>Add this group to the NTFS permissions with &quot;Read&quot; Access</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You&#39;ll need to add this group itself and not nest it inside of another one.</p>
