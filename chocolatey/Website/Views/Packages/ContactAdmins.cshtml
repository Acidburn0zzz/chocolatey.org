<p class="message">
    Important: This form is for contacting site administrators about packages that are seriously neglected or to work through the package triage process to become a co-maintainer. If "@Model.PackageId" simply doesn't 
    appear to work or work correctly, please 
    <a href="@Url.Action(MVC.Packages.ContactOwners(Model.PackageId))" title="contact the maintainers">contact the maintainers of "@Model.PackageId".</a> 
    <br /><br />
    Note: If you want to report abuse, please <a href="@Url.Action(MVC.Packages.ReportAbuse(Model.PackageId, Model.PackageVersion))" title="Report Abuse">report abuse</a>.
    <br /><br />
    If you are contacting the admins for a package that is outdated, please be sure you have contacted the maintainers of the package first and waited the allotted time prior to continuing the package triage process.
</p>    

<p class="error">
    Currently we have a very large backlog of packages in moderation queue (popularity is a double-edged sword) and are addressing it, but as a result moderation may take 
    upwards of two or more weeks until we resolve issues. <br />
    For urgent issues (including packages that are security releases), please reach out to us immediately on <a href="https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco">Gitter</a>.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>Things we are doing to help resolve the large backlog of moderation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adding in a service to automatically verify the install and uninstall of packages.</li>
    <li>Adding some auto-moderation for things a computer can check in a package.</li>
    <li>Adding more moderators</li>
</ul>
                        
<p>Please provide a detailed report.</p>

<p class="warning">
    Do not share sensitive information with this form. <br />
    Do not use "&lt;" or "&gt;" with this form - it will not submit correctly.
