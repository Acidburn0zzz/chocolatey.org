    <p>What we've done to resolve the large backlog of moderation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Adding in a service to automatically verify the install and uninstall of packages.</li>
      <li>Adding some auto-moderation for things a computer can check in a package.</li>
      <li>Adding more moderators</li>
    </ul>
