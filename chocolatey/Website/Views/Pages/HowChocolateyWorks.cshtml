                    Chocolatey is a software management solution that gives you the freedom to create a simple software package and then deploy it anywhere you have Windows using any of your familiar configuration or system management tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you ever used yum, apt, pacman or indeed any package managers on Linux, or Homebrew on a Mac, you already know what Chocolatey is. Chocolatey is the Windows package manager, in the same way that yum is a package manager for Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designed to be simple to use, it provides a suite of powerful features that scale for your existing infrastructure, and your future infrastructure. Power and flexibility in one simple product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So whether you are a small or large organization, Chocolatey provides you with the features to be able to manage your Windows software simply, saving you time and resources.
                    Getting started with Chocolatey is quick and easy. You can start using Open Source for free or contact us for a trial of our commercial version.

                    We designed Chocolatey to work with the widest range of Windows operating systems all the way back to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2003.
                    We also support cloud environments such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and any others where Windows platforms are available. Windows Server.Core and Windows Docker Containers as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One product to manage the software on your entire Windows estate cuts training costs for staff saving both money and time that could be better spent elsewhere within your organization.

                <h2>Use Familiar Tools</h2>
                <hr class="border-hr" />
                <p>
                    Chocolatey packages use PowerShell to drive them so no need to learn another language to deploy software which cuts down the time from installation to package deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use Chocolatey to deploy software using the tools you already know. Many configuration management tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, PowerShell DSC, Salt and others have specific support for Chocolatey.
                    Any endpoint manager such as SCCM, Altiris, Connectwise Automate or others that allow you to manage remote deployment can use Chocolatey to manage software.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 px-lg-5">
                <h2>Complete Software Coverage</h2>
                <hr class="border-hr" />
                <p>
                    The software environment on Windows is much more than what is shown in Programs and Features. Which is why Chocolatey manages all software on Windows including software installers, scripts, zip files and internal software.

                <p>
                    Chocolatey package internalization brings all of the resources that a package needs inside your organization.
                    This process allows you to version control your packages and to use Continuous Deployment and automated testing to ensure quick deployment of tested, working packages to your Windows estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The automatic internalization process allows you to use the skills and resources that already exist in the Chocolatey community and bring those tried and tested packages into your organization.
                    Why re-invent the wheel when you can leverage all that experience?
