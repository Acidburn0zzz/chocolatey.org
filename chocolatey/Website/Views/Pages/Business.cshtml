                            We often hear from customers that have manually updated an application or have some auto update feature enabled that sits outside of Chocolatey.
                            This can create complications when trying to ensure consistency between all updates of software and versions. Chocolatey for Business has solved this issue by enabling synchronization between programs and features.
                            This provides better integration with Windows so that you can quickly inspect what has changed and report correctly.

                            Using native installers can be challenging when having to determine the native installer type (MSI, NSIS, InnoSetup, etc). Errors can also occur when passing incorrect instructions and arguments.
                            Chocolatey can simply override the default installation directory from a simple switch you pass to choco helping speed up your deployments and reducing errors.

                            Internet reliability or changes to software updates can mean you don't always get the packages you need when you need them. Chocolatey allows you to build a dedicated repository within your IT environment.
                            This ensures that can build and run your updates from your dedicated Chocolatey repositories and also enable access to to other teams based on your internal policies.
