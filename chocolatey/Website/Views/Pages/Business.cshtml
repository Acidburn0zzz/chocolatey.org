    <h1 class="text-center m-b">Chocolatey for Business</h1>

    <p>Hundreds of IT organizations have adopted Chocolatey to automate and simplify their Windows software management experience.</p>
    <h3>Begin managing your Windows environment in a better way...</h3>

    <p>
      Chocolatey for Business is the enterprise offering that enables companies to adopt a DevOps approach to managing their Windows environment. Allowing you to deliver applications to your users more reliably and faster
      Chocolatey Open Source is great for individuals to get started on automating their Windows management. But when you have complex, critical infrastructure managed by teams, Chocolatey for Business offers more. With our business editions you get all of the benefits of open source Chocolatey together with enhanced capabilities, integrations, and the peace of mind of having a supported platform.
    </p>

    <h3>Deliver End to End automation through customised packages</h3>

    <p>Save time and reduce complexity by creating packages directly from software installers in seconds.
      We often hear from our customers that they are increasingly under pressure to  deliver more software applications faster and reliably. With multiple versions to support it has only become time consuming and complex. Chocolatey for Business helps by automating the the task of application installation. Chocolatey can figure out how to install the various components and creates an entire package surrounding the process.  Effort can be reduced from hours to minutes. Whilst also reducing human error and ensuring consistency. By leveraging our powerful platform you can begin to build your customised packages for various use cases. Allowing you to automate the entire lifecycle in minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Improve consistency - synchronization with programs & features</h3>

    <p> Ensure that your updates are consistent across all updates.</p>

    <p>We often hear from customers that have manually updated an application or have some auto update feature enabled that sits outside of Chocolatey.  This can create complications when you are trying to ensure there consistency between all updates of software and versions. Chocolatey for Business has solved this issue by enabling synchronization between programs and features. This provides better integration with Windows so that you can quickly inspect what has changed and report correctly.</p>

    <h3>Streamline and accelerate deployments</h3>
    <p>Install Directory Override helping you minimize your effort and reduce errors.</p>

    <p>Using native installers can be challenging when having to determine the native installer type (MSI, NSIS, InnoSetup, etc). Errors can also occur when passing incorrect instructions and arguments.  Chocolatey can simply override the default default installation directory from a simple switch you pass to choco helping speed up your deployments and reducing errors.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility of packages</h3>
    <p>Ability to create custom private repository ensures that you will get access to packages all of the time.</p>

    <p>Internet reliability or changes to software updates can mean you don't always get the packages you need when you need them. Chocolatey allows you to build  a dedicated repository within your IT environment. This ensures that can build and run your updates from your dedicated Chocolatey repositories and also enable access to to other teams based on your internal policies.</p>

    <h3>Secure & Validated: Runtime Malware & Virus Protection minimizing risk.</h3>

    <p>With the ongoing threat of viruses and malware it's important that you can trust the packages you access and run. Especially as you look to manage your Windows environment more securely.</p>

    <p>We offer two options for our customers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Managed Service: When Chocolatey downloads resources as part of a package install, Chocolatey for Business will automatically check the executables prior to running any content. If a certain number of positives have been identified (configurable), Chocolatey will fail the install automatically (can be overridden). Chocolatey partners with VirusTotal to offer this service.</li>
      <li>Integrated: If prefer to leverage your existing antivirus solution Chocolatey can be easily integrated with your current antivirus product.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Peace of Mind: Prioritization of Bugs and Features backed with customer support.</h3>

    <p>For our Chocolatey Business customers we offer expert help from our team of support engineers. Your subscription includes access to new releases, bug fixes, and knowledge base. You can also get support and advice from our ever growing community.</p>
