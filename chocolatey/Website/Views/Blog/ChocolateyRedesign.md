### Community Package Repository
#### A Fresh New Look 
The <a href="/packages">Chocolatey Community Repository</a> got a makeover! The new look features a grid view of packages, in a clean Chocolatey theme. All the same, functionality still exists, only now in an easier to view format. At the top of each package page you'll notice a simple tabbed interface that contains commands for you to easily copy/paste for installing, upgrading, and installing.

#### Updates for Maintainers
##### 1. Improvements to Moderation Filtering
You've always been able to see how many packages in moderation, but now you can filter down by packages that are "Waiting for Maintainer", or "Ready for Review", etc. Click the header counts to view the packages, or drill down further with the dropdown list that appears while in the moderation queue.

##### 2. Choose Your Default Package View
Are you a moderator who spends a lot of time in the Moderator Queue? Well, good news. Now you can make the Moderator Queue your default view, so whenever you go to the Community Packages area you'll instantly be taken to where you need to go. Changing your view is easy, simply navigate to the Moderator Queue and toggle the switch located near the search filters!

##### 3. Legible Package Communication Area
If you are moderator/maintainer/admin you know how sometimes it has been difficult to keep up in a conversation of a package. Now, each comment is broken down and organized in a way where you can easily get to the information you need and respond appropriately.

##### 4. Show/Hide All Files
