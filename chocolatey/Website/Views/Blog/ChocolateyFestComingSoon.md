[Chocolatey Fest](https://chocolateyfest.com/) is less than a month away! This year’s inaugural user conference, the first of its kind focused on Chocolatey, related technologies, and Windows automation (WinOps), takes place 8 October at the Park Central Hotel in San Francisco.  

We’ve got a great lineup planned for you, with keynotes, track sessions and workshops centered around the topics our community cares about: automated testing and deployment, infrastructure as code, containers, security, saving time, and more.

Plus you’ll get to meet the people behind Chocolatey, and network with WinOps experts from companies like Facebook, Microsoft, Red Hat, Yelp, and others.

Subject line: Please send me to Chocolatey Fest this October

Dear [Boss],

As our team has discovered, automation and other DevOps practices aren’t just for Linux shops; it’s increasingly important for Windows teams too. We’ve already seen some success with [name a recent automation project/initiative], and now we need to turn our attention to [name an upcoming initiative/goal].

Chocolatey Fest, a Windows automation conference in San Francisco on 8 October, can help provide the education and best practices we need to reach that goal. The conference brings together WinOps experts from Facebook, Red Hat and Yelp — companies that are leading the way when it comes to Windows automation — and highlights how their teams have use Chocolatey and related technologies to increase time to value, reduce errors, and improve security.

A ticket to Chocolatey Fest includes:
* A full day of sessions on Windows automation, infrastructure as code, testing, security, and more.
* Conversations centered around tools we already use (and some we’re considering), like Chocolatey, Vagrant, Docker, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Azure, AWS and others.
* An evening Hackathon with workshops centered around Docker on Windows, and best practices for deploying Chocolatey.
* Networking with other sysadmins, architects and developers who are tackling some of the same challenges that we are.

The Early Bird conference ticket costs just $200, and the Hackathon is free. With travel and accommodations totaling [fill in cost], the all-in cost would be [total].

I hope you’ll agree that Chocolatey Fest is a worthwhile investment for our company and that you’ll approve my attendance at this year’s event.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
