#### Leave items as they are in the nugetgallery folder

 1. Please don't fix anything in the `nugetgallery` folder or subfolder. Instead you should copy the unchanged item over to `chocolatey/Website`.
 1. Then remove the old item from the Visual Studio project and add the newly copied item to the project.
 1. Save the project and commit your changes.
 1. Make your changes as normal now.
